/**
 * A form in a focused dialog, wrapped around a server action (AM-09 DESIGN §4.3).
 *
 * The sibling of `ConfirmActionDialog`, not a reuse of it. That component is
 * shaped for the destructive path — one irreversible act, a confirm, a result —
 * and everything about its vocabulary says so: `confirmLabel`, `destructive`,
 * "are you sure". A lifecycle form is the opposite case. Receiving a delivery or
 * assigning a laptop is the ordinary work of the register, it takes real input,
 * and framing it as a confirmation would train the operator to click through the
 * one dialog in the app that genuinely means stop.
 *
 * **What it does share is every in-flight guarantee**, because those are about
 * the dialog and not about what it is asking. AM-09 DESIGN §5, guards 2-4:
 *
 *  2. Dismissing NEVER submits. Escape, the overlay, the X and Cancel all close
 *     and do nothing else — `type="button"` on every one of them, because a
 *     bare <button> inside a <form> is a submit button.
 *  3. While the action is in flight the dialog cannot be dismissed at all, the
 *     submit button is disabled, and the fields are frozen. A modal that
 *     vanishes mid-flight leaves the operator with no idea whether it happened.
 *  4. The result is shown, not swallowed — a rejection from the lifecycle guard
 *     ("this asset is already assigned") renders in place, so the operator can
 *     fix the input and retry without losing what they typed.
 *
 * Guard 1 holds too and reads differently here: the trigger opens the dialog and
 * submits nothing. For a confirmation that is the whole point; for a form it is
 * simply that opening a form does not run it.
 *
 * Those guarantees are asserted ONCE, in `test/action-dialog-guards.tsx`, and
 * both this and `ConfirmActionDialog` are run through it. A regression in either
 * fails the same assertion — which is the only way two components can be said to
 * hold the same property rather than to have had it described twice.
 *
 * Like its sibling it does NOT close itself on success: auto-closing would mean
 * reacting to a state change during render, and the page behind has already
 * revalidated, so the dialog is reporting rather than blocking.

/**
 * Owns nothing but "is it open" and "which run is this" (§5 guard 5).
 *
 * `useActionState` has no reset, and its value lives exactly as long as the
 * component that called it. Neither dialog unmounts when it closes — the
 * trigger stays on the page — so on the second open the hook still holds the
 * FIRST run's result: `succeeded` is true, the fieldset is gone, and the only
 * control left is the Done button that closes it again. The action becomes
 * unreachable until something remounts the whole page. The Users page
 * "Add user…" button is the live case, since it is on screen permanently and
 * adding a second user is the ordinary thing to do next.
 *
 * A fresh instance IS the reset, so the run below is keyed and the key is
 * bumped on the way IN. Bumping it on the way out — the more obvious reading
 * of "reset when the dialog closes" — resets the same state, but unmounts the
 * subtree at exactly the moment Radix needs it alive: the close animation is
 * cut, and focus return to the trigger targets a node that has already been
 * destroyed, dropping a keyboard operator at <body>. Resetting on open buys
 * the same freshness while the close path stays entirely Radix's.
 *
 * `open` stays HERE rather than inside the run, because the run is what
 * remounts: state that has to survive the reset cannot live in the thing being
 * reset.

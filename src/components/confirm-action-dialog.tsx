/**
 * A confirmation dialog wrapped around a server action (AM-09 DESIGN §5).
 *
 * Replaces `window.confirm`, which could not carry a field, could not explain a
 * consequence in more than one sentence, and — because it is a blocking browser
 * modal — could not show the result either. The three call sites it replaces
 * are the closest things this app has to a delete.
 *
 * **What this must never become is a weaker guard than the `confirm()` it
 * replaced.** That is the specific failure LEARNINGS §Frontend records as
 * "lift-verbatim drops cross-cutting guards": the behaviour was correct in the
 * source and was never written down as an acceptance criterion, so the rewrite
 * quietly loses it. The properties being preserved, each with a test:
 *
 *  1. The action cannot fire without a second, explicit act. The trigger opens
 *     the dialog and submits nothing; only the confirm button submits.
 *  2. Dismissing NEVER submits. Escape, the overlay, the X and Cancel all close
 *     and do nothing else — `type="button"` on every one of them, because a
 *     bare <button> inside a <form> is a submit button.
 *  3. While the action is in flight the dialog cannot be dismissed at all, and
 *     the confirm button is disabled. A modal that vanishes mid-flight leaves
 *     the operator with no idea whether the thing happened.
 *  4. The result is shown, not swallowed. A rejection ("this would leave no
 *     active IT admin") is the reason the dialog exists, so it renders in
 *     place and the operator can retry or cancel.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT close itself on success. Auto-closing would need to
 * react to a state change during render, and for an irreversible action the
 * acknowledgement is worth a click — the page behind has already revalidated,
 * so the dialog is reporting, not blocking.

 *
 * `useActionState` outlives a close, so without a fresh instance per open the
 * second open still shows the first run's result and offers no way to run the
 * action again. Every call site today happens to hide its own trigger once the
 * action succeeds — a deactivated user renders the Reactivate control instead,
 * a retired asset stops offering Retire — so the stale state is currently
 * unreachable here and reachable in `FormDialog`. That is a property of those

     * and once in each of the three Radix escape hatches below.
     *
     * For ESCAPE that is a genuine redundancy: `onEscapeKeyDown` and
     * `onOpenChange` each stop it on their own, so a mutant removing either one
     * survives no matter how good the test is. Those two are ignored below, and
     * the behaviour itself IS proven — see "refuses Escape and keeps the dialog
     * open while pending".
     *
     * For the OVERLAY it is not redundancy, it is an untested route:
     * `onPointerDownOutside` and `onInteractOutside` are deliberately NOT
     * ignored, and Stryker reports them as no-coverage, because nothing
     * exercises overlay dismissal at all. jsdom cannot: Radix sets
     * `pointer-events: none` on <body>, so userEvent refuses the click
     * (LEARNINGS §Testing — pointer/layout behaviour belongs in a real-browser
     * smoke). Leaving them red keeps that gap on the report instead of burying
     * it in an ignore list.
     *
     * All four are kept rather than thinned because `showClose={!pending}` is
     * the only thing currently keeping the X button away from `onOpenChange`,
     * and that is a rendering decision one prop-change away from being wrong.

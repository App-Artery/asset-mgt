/**
 * The four AM-09 DESIGN §5 guards, asserted through the shared helper that
 * `FormDialog` also runs through — see `test/action-dialog-guards.tsx` for why
 * they live there rather than being written out once per dialog.
 *
 * This file is the harness, plus ONE local test. The guards are one property
 * held by two components, not two descriptions free to drift — but the
 * hidden-fields test below stays here rather than moving into the helper,
 * because it exists to kill a specific mutant in THIS component
 * (`confirm-action-dialog.tsx` is in the `mutate` list; `form-dialog.tsx` is
 * not), and the mutation score is measured against it. Worth revisiting if
 * FormDialog is ever added to that list.

    // WHY THIS TEST EXISTS: mutation testing (issue #12) found that replacing
    // the `hiddenFields` map with `() => undefined` — rendering no hidden
    // inputs at all — killed nothing. Every §5 guard asserts that the action
    // fires, or does not; none asserted that it fires WITH ITS SUBJECT. A
    // deactivate confirmed against no userId is not a weaker dialog, it is a
    // broken one, and all four guards would still have passed.
    //
    // Selected BY NAME rather than counted. An earlier version asserted
    // `toHaveLength(1)` over every hidden input in the form, which is a
    // stricter claim than this test makes and one this component is
    // particularly likely to trip over: the form is bound to a server action
    // through `useActionState`, and React injects its own hidden fields into
    // such forms for progressive enhancement. A mock action does not, so the
    // count passed — under a real one it would fail while the property being
    // guarded still held.
    //
    // Verified rather than assumed: the map compiles to exactly ONE mutant
    // (ArrowFunction at confirm-action-dialog.tsx, `() => undefined`), and it
    // is a 1 -> 0 mutation. Nothing in the mutant set can render a SECOND
    // hidden input, so the count assertion had no mutant of its own to kill;
    // this selector kills the same mutant. Re-run scoped if that line changes:
    //   pnpm exec stryker run --mutate 'src/components/confirm-action-dialog.tsx'

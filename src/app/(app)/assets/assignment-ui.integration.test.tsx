// page and the register FETCH no assignment and no person data — not "fetch it
// and hide it". So the assertions are on the QUERIES AND THEIR RESULTS, never on
// the rendered HTML: rendered-HTML assertions pass just as well when the data is
// loaded and merely not printed, which is exactly the bug they would need to
// catch. Every Prisma model operation the page issues is recorded through a
// client extension and inspected.
//
// Real DB, not mocks: what is being asserted is which tables the page touches,
// and a mock returns the same canned rows whatever the query said.
